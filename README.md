To start the game, simply browse to the file index.html, in the root directory of the project.  This game should work across multiple browsers, and was developed on Chrome.  The game will track a high score, which will be reset if the page is reloaded.

To play the game, use the cursor keys (left, right, up, down) to move your character around the board.  Your character will travel in discrete steps of one tile in the desired direction.

You will receive one point for each tile you move without being hit by a bug.  You will receive a bonus of 50 points for reaching the blue tiles at the top of the board game.  The game ends when reach the blue tiles, or are hit by a bug.  At that point, a results screen is shown, and you may press <space> to play a new round.

Try to set a high score, and then beat it!
